Voice from the Ether: OH, well hello there. Pretty fine day, huh? Pretty fine maze? 

C1: I mean, sure, yeah, it's a pretty fine maze, a bit simple maybe.
C2: THIS MAZE IS TRANCH, MAN.

if C1:
	Voice from the Ether: Huh... that's... pretty bold of you, dog, to suggest that this is a simple space. You know people have to like, carve this junk out, right? Well, whatever, you should be out in a jiffy, then.
if C2:
	Voice from the Ether: ... Well you're about to get it right in the exactly where it's coming to you, friend.

Voice from the Ether: HUH, look at that! It's almost like there's some contingency plan to donk up fools like you who think this place is simple. Wild days. 

C1: It uh, still looks pretty easy, though. 
C2: What the- let me out of here you dillweed!

if C1: 
	Voice from the Ether: Thank goodness it probably only switches things up on you once then, huh?
if C2:
	Voice from the Ether: IF THIS MAZE IS SO SIMPLE GET YOURSELF OUT OF IT, DILLWEED.
